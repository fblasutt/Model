	\label{fig:surplus dist_i_2d}
\end{figure}


Something we have learned
\begin{itemize}
	\item The match surplus at meeting is higher for women (Figure \ref{fig:surplus dist_i_2d}): this is an implication of the (close to) symmetric nash bargaining (SNB) and women earning less than men. SNB allocates a higher share of the surplus to the spouse having lower earnings. 
	\item Women are more likely to hit the participation constraint than men (Figure \ref{fig:surplus dist_2d}). Since, again, women's marginal utility is higher than for men, the same shock implies a larger change in reservation utilities for women than for men.
	\item If we impose a non-symmetric nash bargaining, the gender who gets a higher weight will be less likely to hit participation constraints.
	\item If we close the gender wage gap, the patterns in renegotiation and surplus share distribution become gender symmetric
	
	\item To be checked with the policy experiment how labor supply is reacting. If, when outside option for women improve, labor supply goes down, our model cannot replicate it. 
	
	\item Excess kurtosis of women consumption seems to be driven by renegotiations 
\end{itemize}
